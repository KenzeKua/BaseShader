Assignment : Audio Visualizer with GLSL

- Implement audio visualizer using GLSL and C++.

- Use Fmod to play the music and retrieve the audio data.

- The rectangle mesh(2 triangles, 6 vertices) should fill the entire screen.

- You are not allowed to use more than total 12 uniform variables, 
you are suggested to process the audio data(beat detection, etc) in CPU(C++ code) 
and update the visualization information through uniform variables to GPU(GLSL code).

Restrictions :

1) Max 6 vertices

2) Max 12 uniform variables (either float or int, 
if you send an uniform array variable with the size of 12, it's counted as 12.)

3) Max 1 texture
